Network Protocol Analysis Using Wireshark

In this project, I learned the basics of working with Wireshark, a tool for analyzing network protocols, and conducted a practical analysis of provided traffic files (PCAP). I identified the files used for demonstration and analysis (http1.pcapng and Exercise.pcapng) and familiarized myself with the main features and interface of Wireshark. During the general packet analysis, I examined the properties of captured data, including the total number of packets and the file's hash value, and found the flag in the comments of the captured data.

In the detailed packet dissection, I analyzed packet #38 to determine the markup language used, the packetâ€™s arrival date, the TTL value, the TCP payload size, and the e-tag. For packet navigation, I learned how to search for specific strings in the data and read packet comments, exported an object (JPEG file) and calculated its MD5 hash, found a text file in the traffic, exported it, and read its contents.

In packet filtering, I applied protocol filters (e.g., HTTP) and determined the number of displayed packets, analyzed the HTTP stream to identify information about authors, including the total number and their names. I also worked with the Expert Information section, where I reviewed and identified the number of warnings.

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of how network protocols operate and acquire practical skills in analyzing network data using Wireshark. The knowledge gained can be applied to identifying vulnerabilities in networks, analyzing traffic, and addressing network security challenges. Working on this project was an excellent experience in mastering network traffic analysis!
